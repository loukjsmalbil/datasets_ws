# Welcome to the Machine Learning Project!
In this project you will focuss on a machine learning analysis in one of the following 4 areas:

### Classical Predictive Analysis
* For instance, predict housing prices based on data.
* Time series 
### Natural Language Processing
* For instance, doing sentiment analysis on bol.com reviews;
* For instance, build a chatbot. 
### Vision and/or object detection;
* For instance, facial recognition 
* For instance, recognising the creator of a work of art.
### Reinforcement and generative learning;
* For instance, teach a computer to generate new images of people.  

**Important** 

Ideally the projects should focus on learning a skill that is transferable to the final project.

It will be an individual project. 


## Project Description



## Project Goals

### Classical Predictive Analysis;
* Apply the programming and ML techniques we have learned as well as some new techniques. 
* Build and compare at least 3 ML models.
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your models. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

### Natural Language Processing
* Integrate a machine learning algorithm in an NLP framework (e.g. a chatbot or sentiment analyzer)  
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your model. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. Demonstrate a working prototype. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.


### Vision and/or object detection;
* Build a machine learning model (neural network or another advanced model) to perform object detection tasks.  
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your model. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. Demonstrate a working prototype. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.

### Reinforcement and generative learning;
* Build a machine learning model (neural network) to generate new data or learn a new skill.  
* Use evaluation metrics to ground your claims and test your model. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. Demonstrate a working prototype. 
* Learn to tailor the style of your communication to the audience.







# Necessary Deliverables

**<span style="color:red">The following deliverables should be pushed to your branch:</span>**

**Jupyter notebook(s)** and **Python file(s)** containing your predictive analysis and the code you used to obtain this analysis. Place the Jupyter notebook in the `your-code` folder.The notebook should be a **self sufficient document**. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebook, understand your analysis, where to find the data and how to store the data locally so that the notebooks runs smoothly.<br>

**<span style="color:red">The following deliverables should NOT be pushed to your branch:</span>** <br>
- **DATA** Please do not upload any data to the repository but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do. You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder. 
- **Presentation Slides** A presentation of your results on the day of the presentations. You will have to present using a slideshow or a complete workable programme, **NOT A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.** <br>

Please use [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ypxj9A3VvTXHLMbKCIOLES25ohLhlGpF?usp=sharing) where  personal folders have already been made and where you can store data, presentations and any additional documentation </span>**

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!).
* Ask for help but also remember: Google is your friend!
* Start simple! 
* Learn about your subject and understand what research has been done already.
* You *can* use data from the projects your partners did in the last weeks. You can't use your own project.
* Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
* Use the notebook and markdown to guide the reader through your analysis and tell the story
* Explain what insight or information is inferred from your visualizations
* Make extensive use of comments, docstrings and markdown
